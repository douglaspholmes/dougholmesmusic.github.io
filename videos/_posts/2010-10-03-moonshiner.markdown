description: Doug Holmes from Another Hundred Miles playing "Moonshiner" in West Windsor, NJ in 2010. "Moonshiner" is a classic folk song that dates back to the 1930's and has been recorded by Bob Dylan, Uncle Tupelo, Cat Power, and Elliot Smith (among many others). I suppose I play it the Uncle Tupelo way.
